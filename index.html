				The steps of City Hall  were flooded with parents, elected officials, and public advocates, all fighting for changes in a busing policy that was made in 1979. Over 100 advocates for children of New York alongside several other organizations and advocacy groups stood together Monday afternoon with a shared goal of better busing for schools, and a re-bid of school bus contracts. 
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				The current policy for buses was created 46 years ago following a union strike that disrupted NYC. 
			</p>
			<p>
			“We are PIST (pissed),” said Sara Catalinotto who says she has watched the system degrade during the time her son (now 18) was taking the bus.
			</p>
			<p>
Cantalinotto was there with other members of Parents to Improve School Transportation (PIST) who shared personal experiences that they had to face, relying on school buses to get their kids to school. The acronym stems from the parents themselves who grew frustrated with the conditions their children are placed in. 
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
			“You’re spending just as much time on the bus as you are in school." said Cantalinotto.  
			</p>
			<p>
PIST was formed over ten years ago, and members are proposing the School Bus Bill of Rights, focusing on nine areas of concern including routing, staffing, accomodations, accountability and more.

			Nya Bergh, a representative for NYC Appleseed, which advocates for integration in the city school system, was standing in front of parents and other organizers, many of which carrying signs and chanting in support. 
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
			“Parents have been shouting into the void about the daily struggle to get their child to school, safely, reliably and on time,” Bergh said.  “They happen over and over and over again.” 			</p>
			</p>
			<p>
			Each story shared on the steps of City Hall echoed the next. In the most extreme examples, parents said they were left wondering where their kids even were. 			</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				Naveed Hasan, a concerned parent of two young children himself says “The contractors have us over a barrel”. Hasan claims that the route he was given for one of his children involved traveling in the opposite direction of the school, farther than it would be to just walk to his school, effectively doubling the time and distance it would take for his child to arrive on time.

				New York Senator Robert Jackson shouts and chants with parents. Jackson recently introduced Bill S1018 that protects school bus workers wages and benefits between employers. Even though the bill has yet to make it far yet, Jackson is passionate “Our children’s safety cannot be sacrificed to the lowest bidder.”
